# About The Author
My name is Abdurahman Elmawi. I myself am a Type 1 Diabetic and heavily rely on this application. In pursuit of trying to get better blood sugars and make diabetes less of a hassle, I created this app, based on some previous work I'd done to try and predict blood sugars. With this app and the proper discipline, you can very easily achieve an HbA1C (mg/dL) under 5.5%. Depending on your meals, too, you can get your A1C as low as 4.7%. This app can seriously help your blood sugars, especially with those who are already doing a Bernstein-type diet.
